# dappnet feature tracker

Hey welcome! 

This is an open feature tracker for Dappnet.

Here you'll find the features we're currently working on, and research and development we want to do!

## FAQ's.

**Why a separate feature tracking repo?**

I want to cultivate a particular type of space which is quiet, thoughtful, and dedicated to maintaining an energy of experimentation. Crypto projects suffer from intolerable levels of noise, which detracts from focus. This has even moved into issue trackers on Github - and so for the peace of mind, this is a separate repo, focused on discussing **features** only (not bug requests, not "why have I lost my tokens", etc). 

**Why are you not publishing code yet?**

There are some legal and commercial reasons why we can't share just yet. Fear not, we will make the core available soon.
